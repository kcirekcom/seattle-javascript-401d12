# Welcome

Welcome to Code 401 Javascript! This is a class that builds on your fundamental Javascript programming knowledge to make you a proficient full-stack Javascript developer, and to prepare you for getting a job in today's Javascript job market!

# Introduction
In this class we are going to cover a lot of advanced web development topics. The first 5 weeks of this course will be dedicated to learning back-end development using **Node.js**. In this section of the course you will learn to create authenticated RESTful APIs with persistent storage. In the second 5 weeks of this course we will be focusing on learning advanced front-end web development. In this section of the course you will learn to create client side web applications using **AngularJS**, that interact with RESTful APIs to authenticate users and persist data.

# Course Layout
This course has been organized and structured to spread across 10 weeks. With the exception of project weeks, each week will have around 2-3 lecture/lab units. The class schedule is Monday-Friday from 9am - 6pm. Lecture will take place from 1pm - 4pm daily and co-working time is scheduled from 9am - 12pm.  There will also be an instructor or TA available for an hour after lecture, from 4pm - 5pm.  You are welcome to leave at that time or can stick around as there will likely still be help available for another hour.

# Lecture Code
Each day of class will include a new directory created named after the class number, and the topics covered that day, _e.g._ `lecture-01-modular-patterns`.  After each lecture the code demos from lecture will be placed in a lecture directory, with a correlated naming convention to make things easy to locate.  There will also be a daily outline `README` that displays the high-level topics and objectives for that day.

# Assignments
All readings, homework, labs, and quizzes will be published, in Canvas, the week before they are assigned. All coding assignment instructions and materials will be organized into git repositories and will be published the day of the assignment.  Most assignments are due the same evening.
